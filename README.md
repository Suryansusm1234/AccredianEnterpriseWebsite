## ⏱️ Development Time & Workflow

The project was completed in approximately **3 hours 45 minutes**, focusing on rapid execution while maintaining code quality and structure.

### Development Workflow

* Used AI-assisted design tools to quickly generate an initial UI structure, significantly reducing design iteration time
* Leveraged AI to scaffold component structures and API routes
* Refined layout, component architecture, and responsiveness manually
* Implemented validation logic, API integration, and admin panel with deliberate engineering decisions
* Used AI selectively for debugging and optimization, while maintaining full understanding of the codebase

The focus was on using AI as an **accelerator for development speed**, while ensuring that all architectural and implementation decisions were made consciously.
